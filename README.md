# Data_Analytics_AirBnB

This is a simple project that analyzes and presents key data matrics from a popular lodging service - AirBnB. 

Datas were analyzed  using three different python modules independent of each other. These are:

### CSV module
### Pandas module
### MatPlotLIb module

###### - The CSV module was used to show how one can seamlessly filter/search through datasets.
###### - The pandas library was used to carry out certain mathematical manipulations to reveal patterns.
###### - Matplotlib helped in visualization of data to catch an wholistic view of data trends and information.

The code was designed to be interactive.

Run the main python program - **main.py** -  and you'd be guided through a set of instructions on each functionality ofthe project.

It's a practice project. Do well to leave a review. Thank you.
