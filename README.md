# Data_Analytics_AirBnB

This is a simple project that analyzes and presents key data matrics from a popular lodging service - AirBnB. This is important because it can help give you a quick start on the various functionalities of the different libraries used. Also, you'd see the various python syntax used and how it can help you write better codes.

Datas were analyzed  using three different python modules independent of each other. These are:

### CSV module
### Pandas module
### MatPlotLIb module

###### - The CSV module was used to show how one can seamlessly filter/search through datasets.
###### - The pandas library was used to carry out certain mathematical manipulations to reveal patterns.
###### - Matplotlib helped in visualization of data to catch an wholistic view of data trends and information.

The code was designed to be interactive.

Run the main python program - **main.py** -  and you'd be guided through a set of instructions on each functionality ofthe project.

It's a practice project. Do well to leave a review. Thank you.
